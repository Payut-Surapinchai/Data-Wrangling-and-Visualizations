# Data Wrangling and Visualizations
Instructor: Adam Spiegler

This repository consists of all my courseworks and projects from Data wrangling and Visualizations course in University of Colorado Denver. Through the Data wrangling and Visualizations course, I've learned how to do some advanced data wrangling, advanced data visualizations, statistical calculations, and in-depth exploratory data analysis in R. The materials here demonstrates my ability to work with real-world datasets, applying the techniques from the course, and communicating the insights effectively.

## Contents
**Note: `Homework 8` and `Homework 9` are stored as `.qmd` file. I would recommend to use either RStudio or Posit Cloud to open these files.**

- `Homework 1`: This homework introduces R and Google Colab(for running R).

- `Homework 2`: This assignment is about basics of plotting, R data structures, R data types, creating & slicing data frames, how to create functions, and how to use functions in R.

- `Homework 3`: In this assignment, he introduces a package called `ggplot2`. Which is a package that contains a lot of good functions for plotting.

- `Homework 4`: This homework file goes more in-depth into `ggplot2`. In this file, I'm starting to do more advanced problem solving using `ggplot2`. 

- `Homework 5`: This homework assignment introduces a new package called `dplyr`. This package is used for data manipulation in R.

- `Homework 6`: In this homework, my instructor introduces another new package called `tidyr`. This package helps with tidying and cleaning the data, making the data ready for analysis.

- `Homework 7`: This assignment is about various ways you can import data whether its a `.xlsx` or `.csv` file along with multiple configurations that you can do while importing the                     data.

- `Homework 8`: In this assignment, he introduces Posit Cloud and RStudio for running and creating new files that are not `.ipynb`, but are `.qmd` files. In addition, he also introduces                 a new package called `plotly` which makes it possible for creating interactive plots.

- `Homework 9`: This homework is about spatial data and special features which are crucial data for creating interactive maps, or just a map plot in general.

- `Homework 10`: This homework file introduces matrices, arrays, and lists as well as manipulating the matrices, arrays, and lists in R.
  
- `Homework 11`: This assignment is about control statements, iterations, and bootstrapping.

- `Homework 12`: In this homework, he introduces a new concept of `apply` family of functions where he explained what each variations of `apply` did and where you can use them.

- `Homework 13`: This homework is about creating a website using Github Pages.

## Instructions
To open the file and edit, download the files and use Jupyter notebook or Google Colab to open the file(I recommend Google Colab). In addition, make sure that your Jupyter notebook or Google colab has the packages that needs to be imported to run the code cells in the file. The first code cell will indicate all the packages/libraries that you need to import to run the file. 

However for `Homework 8` and `Homework 9`, I recommend you open the file with RStudio or Posit Cloud because the file is stored as `.qmd` and not `.ipynb`.

## About me
I'm an undergraduate in University of Colorado Denver who is majoring in Data Science, building a strong foundation on Python, C++, and R. Along with the data wrangling, data visualizations, and exploratory data analysis techniques in Python and R. I'm passionate about solving problems with data and learning new tools & techniques.
